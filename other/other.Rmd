This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
dat <- get_cases()

pro <- unique(dat$state)

pro

prova <- dat %>% 
  separate(state, c("a", "b"), ",") 

list("VT", " MN", " FL", " GA", " TX", " KY", " LA", " CA", 
" SC", " IA", " MA", " TN", " OR", " MD", " IN", " NJ", " KS", 
" WA", " MO", " NY", " VA", " NH", " D.C.", " PA", " AZ", " UT", 
" CO", " HI", " OR ", " OK", " RI", " NC", " NE", " NV", " IL"
)

library(htmltools)
dat %>%
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%      
  addCircleMarkers(~Long, ~Lat, label = ~htmlEscape(state), radius = 2, clusterOptions = "yes")  # third line




```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
